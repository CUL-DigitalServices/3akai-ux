                        <p>When you return your edited manuscript to your publisher you are asked to sign a Copyright Transfer Agreement. This is standard in most traditional publication agreements. It is important for you to retain rights as an author enabling you to publish your work open access, use it in teaching materials and to promote your research work i.e., via your website.  As the publishing landscape shifts it is important that you know how your work might be affected.</p>

                            <p>A traditional publisher’s agreement, which sees you transfer copyright to the publisher, might affect your eligibility for the next REF which requires work to be open access at the time of publication. A traditional copyright agreement may affect your ability to share your work online.</p>
                            <p>Retaining copyright, or adding an addendum which allows you to comply with funders’ open access policies will ensure your work is eligible. It will also help you reach a wider audience and have more control over how the distribution of your work online.</p>

                        <p>If you have already opted for a “pay to publish” model you may need to pay an Article Processing Charge, or APC. Depending on the funder, the University can support you in covering this publishing fee. We can check your publication options and advise you what to do. The University’s preferred option for open access is to use a self-archiving University of Cambridge Repository which requires you to upload your manuscript.</p>
                        <p>Open access funds are available at the University, funded by RCUK and The Wellcome Trust. This support enables researchers to comply with open access criteria. Both funding bodies have set conditions linked to the use of a publisher’s fee.</p>
                        <p>The University can pay for colour and page charges for RCUK funded articles only. The University cannot pay for image costs. These are the responsibility of the author.</p>

                        <p>With different funder and publication policies impacting on open access, the University has opted for the self-archiving method. HEFCE policy requires articles and conference proceedings to be available in an open access repository if they are to be eligible. To reduce confusion and to maintain and ensure compliance with funder policy we would recommend you upload your manuscript to ensure it is eligible for the next REF. The university can support you with some publisher’s fees.</p>

                        <p>To be eligible for the next REF your research needs to comply with funder policies, as well as publishers. HEFCE policy requires peer reviewed articles and conference proceedings to be available in an open access repository if they are to be eligible. Articles on ArXiv are generally pre-print and not peer reviewed.</p>

                        <p>The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions (HEIs). This assessment is vital for the funding both of researchers and the university. To allow as much work as possible to be eligible for the next REF, all articles should be made open access.</p>
