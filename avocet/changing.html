                    <p>HEFCE policy is changing and it impacts how your research and scholarly output is eligible for the next REF. The new policy requires articles and conference proceedings to be available in an open access repository if they are to be eligible.</p>
                    <p>RCUK, Wellcome and other funders also have various policies concerning the deposit of research output.</p>
                    <p>By uploading your work and using this service, we will help ensure you meet REF and funder policy requirements.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to enabling your research to flourish while giving you the choice to publish where you want.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>The new open access policies established by HEFCE will impact on the eligibility of your work for the next REF. The funders’ policies, including RCUK and The Wellcome Trust, impact on future access to funding.</p>
                        <p>HEFCE’s current position is that from April 2014 any research to be submitted as a unit of assessment to REF 2020 should be available as open access at the time of publication.</p>
                        <p class="well">HEFCE define open access as peer-reviewed manuscripts to be freely accessible at the time of publication.</p>
                        <p>In 2013, HEFCE conducted a consultation to explore how to make open access a requirement for all research. It is expected this will enforce the upload of manuscript’s to an institutional repository, like this one. Our work to establish this system is to pre-empt and prepare researchers for this policy enforcement.</p>
                        <p><a href="/me">Upload your accepted manuscripts</a> to meet this requirement and make sure you are compliant with both REF, your funder’s and publisher’s open access policies.</p>
