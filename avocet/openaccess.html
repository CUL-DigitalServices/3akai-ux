                    <p>To make scholarly research freely available online is the core principle of open access. We want to encourage this while also asserting that you continue to have control and the ability to choose where to publish.</p>
                    <p>The University of Cambridge has a reputation built on the excellence of research. This research provides the foundation of our international standing but is also tied closely to both our funding and that of our researchers.</p>
                    <p>We want to ensure that you are eligible for the next REF and still able to adhere to your funder’s policy.</p>

                            <h3>Why open access?</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>The move towards open access is motivated by two things; the importance of free and open access to research and the new policies established by HEFCE and other funders, including RCUK and The Wellcome Trust. This will impact on the eligibility of your work for the next REF.</p>
                        <p>In establishing this service we are ensuring your are compliant with both your funder’s open access policies, publisher’s terms and REF.</p>
                        <p>Open access also allows your work to have a greater visibility and wider recognition as it can reach a larger audience. We want to ensure that all of our researchers are able to continue to receive funding that enables them to continue to do exceptional, high quality and pioneering research while reaching as wide an audience as possible.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits of open access</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>Open access removes any restriction to view, read and to cite a work. The impact is not just on the university and researcher community, it increases access to literature, widening the spread of ideas. Universities are places of research and by improving student and teacher access to literature we enhance this reputation. Access to knowledge is increased. This has both a societal and an economic impact.</p>
                        <p>For the author and researcher, open access enables them  to raise the visibility and profile of their research and to increase its impact.</p>
                        <p>This move towards openness and transparency is positive for the awareness and visibility of publicly-funded research.</p>

                            <h3>How open access affects the publishing cycle (open access publishing options)</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>Open access affects how your work is shared and viewed. By establishing this service we are ensuring both that you comply with funders’ policies and that your work is eligible for the next REF.</p>
                        <p>There are two different models for open access; Self-archiving versus ‘Pay to Publish’</p>

                                <h4>Self-archiving</h4>
                            </header>
                            <p>The deposit of peer reviewed manuscripts in an open access repository. This is often described as the “Green” model. Publishers often stipulate a fixed period of time before the article can be made freely available (an embargo).</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>This increases the availability and visibility of your work</li>
                                <li>It removes the need for a publications fee</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>But;</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The embargo process delays the accessibility of published work</li>
                                <li>There is a reliance for researchers to upload their own papers, adding to workload</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The university prefers the self-archiving model yet we are conscious of ensuring this new system is as simple and accessible as possible for researchers.</p>

                            <p>This provides free universal access to the final published versions of articles immediately on publication with the requirement of a publisher’s fee to be made. This is often described as the “Gold” model.</p>

                            <p>A publisher’s fee, often known as the Article Processing Charge (APC) needs to be paid. The university and funders may help in the payment of this (find out more)</p>

                        <p>The embargo is a fixed period of time a publisher might establish to delay the open access publication of a manuscript. These embargo periods may differ in length from 6 - 12 months and vary in subject fields. This will affect when your manuscript will be able to be viewed and accessed. We can help you find out how a publisher’s embargo might affect you.</p>
