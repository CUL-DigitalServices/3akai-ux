                        <p>Most funders require you to acknowledge your funder when your manuscript is published.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>the funding agency name should be written in full</li>
                            <li>the grant number should be in square brackets</li>
                            <li>multiple grant numbers should be separated by a comma and space</li>
                            <li>funding agencies should be separated by a semi-colon.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>E.g. 'This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number], [grant number]; Medical Research Council [grant number] and Cancer Research UK [grant number]</p>
