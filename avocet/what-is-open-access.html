                    <p>Open access makes scholarly research freely available online. The University’s policy is that you continue to have control and the ability to choose where to publish.</p>

                        <h3>Why Open Access?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The move towards Open Access is motivated by two things; increasing access to published research and the new policies established by HEFCE and other funders, including RCUK and The Wellcome Trust.</p>
                    <p>This service is designed to help you comply with your funders' Open Access policies and ensure your work is eligible for the REF.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Open Access removes restrictions to view and read a work and allows reuse, redistribution and modification of the work with attribution.</p>
                    <p>For the author and researcher, Open Access enables them to raise the visibility and profile of their research and to increase its impact.</p>
                    <p>It also increases access to research, widening the spread of knowledge and ideas.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>There are two main models for Open Access; self-archiving versus pay to publish.</p>

                        <header>
                            <h4>1. Self-archiving (Green Open Access)</h4>
                        </header>

                        <p>The deposit of peer-reviewed manuscripts in an Open Access repository. Publishers often stipulate a fixed period of time before the article can be made freely available (an embargo).</p>
                        <p>What does self-archiving mean for you?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An increase in the availability and visibility of your work</li>
                            <li>It removes the need to pay Open Access charges</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The University prefers the self-archiving model. <a href="/what-do-i-need-to-do" title="Find out more about uploading your manuscript and meeting funder requirements">Find out more about uploading your manuscript</a>.</p>

                        <h5>Embargo</h5>
                        <p>The embargo is a fixed period of time a publisher might establish to delay the Open Access publication of a manuscript. These embargo periods may differ in length from 6 - 36 months and vary in subject fields. This will affect when your manuscript will be able to be viewed and accessed. We can help you find out how a publisher’s embargo might affect you.</p>

                        </header>

                        <p>Free access to the final published versions of articles, immediately on publication. The publisher requires an Article Processing Charge which includes Open Access charges.</p>
                        <h5>What does this mean for you?</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides immediate access to journals as soon as they are published</li>
                            <li>Meets the requirement of certain funders.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The University and funders may help in the payment of this. <a href="/what-do-i-need-to-do#section-open-access-charges" class="oa-link">Find out more</a>.</p>
