<!-- CONTENT -->
<!--
The widget lives in its own container `<div>` which we identify using
a class rather than an id. That allows a single web page to contain
multiple instances of the widget.

_Note that we're using English labels during initial development of the
widget. These should be replaced with localizable keys prior to release._
 -->
<div class="documentpreview-container">
<!--
  The controls for the widget exist in their own `<div>` that's generally
  positioned above the content. We identify that `<div>` as the document
  preview toolbar and "classed" appropriately.
 -->
  <div class="documentpreview-toolbar">
<!--
    Within the document preview toolbar are two sets of controls. The first
    set (generally positioned to the left in left-to-right languages) control
    the zoom level of the display.
 -->
    <span class="zoom-level">
      <button class="zoom-in" title="Zoom In"><i class="icon-zoom-in"></i></button>
      <button class="zoom-out" title="Zoom Out"><i class="icon-zoom-out"></i></button>
      <button class="full-screen" title="View Full Screen"><i class="icon-fullscreen"></i></button>
    </span>
<!--
    The second set of controls (generally positioned to the right in left-
    to-right languages) determine which page(s) in the document are shown.
    
    > _TODO: Verify the proper rendering of this section for right-to-left
    languages. I don't think the standard browser behavior is correct in
    this case, but, not being able to read Hebrew or Arabic, I have a low
    confidence in my own opinion. Consequently, I'm loath to invest any
    time in adjustments until it's clear exactly what adjustments are
    appropriate._
 -->
    <span class="page-position">
      <button class="prev-page" title="Previous Page"><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></button>
      <span class="toolbar-text">Page </span>
      <input type="text" class="page-num">

      <span class="page-count toolbar-text"></span>
      <button class="next-page" title="Next Page"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></button>
    </span>
<!--
    Since everything in the toolbar is normally floating (either right or left),
    we add a clearfix `<div>` to force the toolbar to have a height.
 -->
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
  </div>
<!--
  The document pages themselves live in their own `<div>` container that's
  normally rendered below the tool bar. It's left empty in the template to
  be filled in with actual document pages.
