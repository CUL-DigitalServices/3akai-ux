<!-- CONTENT -->
<!--
The widget lives in its own container `<div>` which we identify using
a class rather than an id. That allows a single web page to contain
multiple instances of the widget.

All widget-specific classes used in this template (except the main
container), have the `dp-` prefix.

_Note that we're using English labels during initial development of the
widget. These should be replaced with localizable keys prior to release._
 -->
<div class="documentpreview-container">
<!--
  The controls for the widget exist in their own `<div>` that's generally
  positioned above the content. We identify that `<div>` as the document
  preview toolbar and "classed" appropriately.
 -->
  <form class="dp-toolbar">
<!--
    Within the document preview toolbar are two sets of controls. The first
    set (generally positioned to the left in left-to-right languages) control
    the zoom level of the display. Note that we have to set the `tabindex`
    explicitly since `<button>` elements are focusable in all browsers by
    default. Setting it to `0`, however, preserves the normal tab order
    so we shouldn't interfere with other parts of the page.
 -->
    <span class="dp-zoom-level">
      <button class="dp-zoom-in" title="Zoom In" tabindex="0"><i class="icon-zoom-in"></i></button>
      <button class="dp-zoom-out" title="Zoom Out" tabindex="0"><i class="icon-zoom-out"></i></button>
      <button class="dp-full-screen" title="View Full Screen" tabindex="0"><i class="icon-fullscreen"></i></button>
    </span>
<!--
    The second set of controls (generally positioned to the right in left-
    to-right languages) determine which page(s) in the document are shown.
    
    We're using left-to-right language conventions for our icons by default
    (i.e. previous = left-facing arrow and next = right-facing arrow) so we
    will need to override the content for right-to-left languages. It seems
    better to keep things as simple as possible for the extremely common case
    though, even if it means extra complications otherwise. Check the CSS
    file for details.
 -->
    <span class="dp-page-position">
      <button class="dp-page-prev" title="Previous Page"><i class="icon-caret-left"></i></button>
      <span   class="dp-page-label dp-toolbar-text">Page</span>
      <input  class="dp-page-num" type="text">
      <span   class="dp-page-prepositon dp-toolbar-text">of</span>
      <span   class="dp-page-count dp-toolbar-text"></span>
      <button class="dp-page-next" title="Next Page"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i></button>
    </span>
<!--
    Since everything in the toolbar is normally floating (either right or left),
    we add a clearfix `<div>` to force the toolbar to have a height.
 -->
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
  </form>
<!--
  The document pages themselves live in their own `<div>` container that's
  normally rendered below the tool bar. It's left empty in the template to
  be filled in with actual document pages.
 -->
  <div class="dp-content">
  </div>
